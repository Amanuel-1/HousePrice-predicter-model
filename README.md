# Machine Learning Model for Sale Price Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a simple machine learning model developed for predicting sale prices based on selected features. The model is implemented using the Linear Regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library.

## Files

- **train.csv**: Dataset used for training the machine learning model.
- **test.csv**: Dataset for evaluating the trained model and making predictions.
- **main.py**: Python script implementing the machine learning model and generating predictions.
- **predictions.csv**: Output file containing predicted sale prices for the test dataset.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
